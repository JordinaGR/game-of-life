# GAME OF LIFE

This is the Conway's game of life implementation. It's very simple, you can only create alive cells dragging the mouse on the grid, click the next botton to show the next stage of the game and a button to clear all alive cells.

Changing the first 3 variables in the main code will resize everything correctly.

This is what the GUI looks like:
